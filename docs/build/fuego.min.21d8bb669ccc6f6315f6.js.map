However, these components can be used in many ways, described in the subsections below.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install react-fuego=git+ssh://git@github.com:apiv/fuego.git\\n```\\n\\n## What problem does this solve?\\n\\n**And why can't I just use `react-addons-perf` instead?**\\n \\n`Fuego` can be though of as an extension of `react-addons-perf`, which provides a UI and controlled \\nenvironment for benchmarking. `react-addons-perf` is a great tool, but every time we used it, we found\\nourselves copying and pasting lines of code into random parts of components to `start` and `stop` the\\n`Perf` recording. Also, when we did record performance in-app, it was difficult to sift through the output\\nto find the component we were looking for.\\n\\n`Fuego` provides:\\n1) A controlled environment for benchmarking. Your component is rendered in complete isolation, so true\\nrendering performance can be measured per component.\\n2) A simpler API. Rather than having to manually paste in where to `start` and `stop` `Perf`, `Fuego` takes\\ncare of that for you. All you need to do is provide `children` nodes.\\n3) A simple, effective UI. Fuego allows you to run your benchmarks at a literal click of a button, displaying\\noutput with a smart reporter.\\n4) Simple and powerful test suite integration. With `Fuego`, it's finally possible to avoid component bloat by defining tests which\\nlimit how slow a component is allowed to render before failing. For examples, scroll to the `Test` section below.\\n5) Analytics (WIP). Right now, the UI outputs the same data output by `Perf.printInclusive`. In the future, we\\nwould like to make the `TestResults` rendering table 'smarter', with simple algorithms to help point out where\\nthe problem is in your component (if it's rendering slowly).\\n\\n### More info\\n\\nFull documentation on the homepage: http://fuego.solutions\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./README.md\n// module id = 439\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"import React from 'react'\\nimport Fuego, { GroupPresenter, Test } from '../../../../src/index'\\n\\nconst MyComponent = ({ someSlowProp = 0 }) => {\\n  (new Array(someSlowProp * 100)).fill('').map(() => 'this will slow things down lol')\\n\\n  return <div>Hello el world</div>\\n}\\n\\nconst GroupPresenterExample = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <GroupPresenter title='Try it out!'>\\n      <Test title='A'>\\n        {Fuego.renderList(MyComponent, 100, {someSlowProp: 0})}\\n      </Test>\\n      <Test title='B'>\\n        {Fuego.renderList(MyComponent, 100, {someSlowProp: 3})}\\n      </Test>\\n      <Test title='C'>\\n        {Fuego.renderList(MyComponent, 100, {someSlowProp: 1})}\\n      </Test>\\n    </GroupPresenter>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nexport default GroupPresenterExample\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./docs/app/components/examples/GroupPresenterExample.js\n// module id = 440\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"import { mount } from 'enzyme'\\nimport Fuego, { Test } from 'react-fuego'\\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent'\\n\\ndescribe('MyComponent', () => {\\n  it('renders within a reasonable time', (done) => {\\n    const onBenchmarkStop = (results) => {\\n      // fail if the total render time is more than 100ms\\n      expect(results[0].inclusiveRenderDuration).to.be.at.most(100)\\n      done()\\n    }\\n\\n    mount(\\n      <Test onBenchmarkStop={onBenchmarkStop}>\\n        {Fuego.renderList(MyComponent, 100)}\\n      </Test>\\n    )\\n  })\\n})\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./docs/app/components/examples/TestExample.js\n// module id = 441\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"import React from 'react'\\nimport Fuego, { TestPresenter, Test } from '../../../../src/index'\\n\\nconst MyComponent = ({ someSlowProp = 0 }) => {\\n  (new Array(someSlowProp * 100)).fill('').map(() => 'this will slow things down lol')\\n\\n  return <div>Hello el world</div>\\n}\\n\\nconst TestPresenterExample = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <TestPresenter title='Test of things'>\\n      <Test.Render>\\n        {Fuego.renderList(MyComponent, 100, {})}\\n      </Test.Render>\\n    </TestPresenter>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nexport default TestPresenterExample\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./docs/app/components/examples/TestPresenterExample.js\n// module id = 442\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"# Group\\n\\nThis is a logic-only component, providing callbacks for when the children finish rendering.
